\chapter{CONCLUSIONS}
In this way the project is completed. This project was a great learning experience for our group members as we successfully implemented theoretical knowledge into practice and succeeded in achieving the goal. It taught us different aspects of game development and more importantly, it taught us to write C++ code in OOP paradigm following certain coding guidelines. This project has filled us with more enthusiasm for more projects of game development and may even guide us to professional game development as a career.

Additionally, we learned about team-work through collaborative problem-solving. We also got the opportunity to learn more about the industry-standard tools and technologies such as \LaTeX\ for typesetting documents, GitHub for version control and hosting of our project, Doxygen for documentation generation, and so on.

This project taught us different aspects of software and game development cycle which includes the stages like debugging, building and testing of the programs. In conclusion, C++ programming language with OOP paradigm is a very powerful tool that can be used in software and game development fields.
