\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank every individual who helped and supported us in having this project completed, through their direct or indirect involvement. We would like to extend our deep gratitude to the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering for the opportunity we were provided to apply our theoretical knowledge into practical form with this project. We would also like to thank our course instructor \textbf{Mr. Bikal Adhikari} for making us familiar with the theoretical aspect of C++ programming language and its Object Oriented approach, and also for providing us valuable guidelines in this project.

Besides, we are grateful to our colleagues of BEI 076 for their cooperation and feedback when we needed. It is not easy to start a project from scratch, especially when the person is a beginner. Hence, we cannot forget to acknowledge the people whose work we have referenced and taken invaluable lessons from in every step of the project, be it while learning some materials or while writing the code.

Lastly, we are indebted to our family members for their understanding and support that we have received not just during the course of our project but our studies as well.
