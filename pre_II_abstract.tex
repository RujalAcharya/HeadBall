\textit{
This project is about making a game called HeadBall in C++ programming language based on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. Headball is a simple cross-platform, multiplayer game played for fun that exist only on digital platform. The sole purpose of creating this game is for learning game development in C++ with OOP approach and for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the practical course on Object Oriented Programming. For this purpose  Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is used for rendering windows and different objects in screen and Box2D is used as physics library to create realistic world in game. Both of these libraries are easily accessible in the web and can be used by reading the documentation. All the codes were written using Visual Studio Code, an open source code editor.   
Although the game is fully functioning, there  are still rooms for improvement and new features can be added to make game better and entertaining. This game is recommended for players of any age group and the game with source code can be downloaded from github. \\
\textbf{Key Words}: Box2D, HeadBall, OOP, SFML
